# Overview

This project is a deep dive into the company Lego. Even though there were many datasets to choose from, I decided to only use the themes and sets datasets to limit the amount of analysis. 

From these datasets we can ask alot of interesting questions about the history of the LEGO company, their product offering, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all:

- What is the biggest LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
- How did the LEGO company start out? When did the first LEGO sets get released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
- Which LEGO theme has the most sets?
- When did the LEGO company increase its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?
- Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
